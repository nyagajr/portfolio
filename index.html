      <p><span style="color:#00f0f0">I'm a learned person apparently. I've studied upto the university level but unfortunately I defered at my third year<br />
        to pursue my interest of coding. I currently have no job experience. I love coding and I know that coding loves me too.</span>
        <br /><br />I'm a person of diverse talents. I play diverse musical instruments like piano and guitar.<br />
      I also practice art(hope I'll be a pro someday to come). I love coding and check me out <br />
